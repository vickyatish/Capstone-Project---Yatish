        "This script fine-tunes OpenAI's `gpt-3.5-turbo` (or `gpt-4`) using a **training and validation dataset**.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 📌: Steps:\n",
        "1. **Upload the training and validation dataset** as `.jsonl` files to OpenAI.\n",
        "2. **Replace the file IDs** in the code.\n",
        "3. **Run the script** to start fine-tuning.\n",
        "4. **Monitor training & validation loss** dynamically.\n",
        "---\n",
        "**Functionality**: This Python code uses OpenAI's API to fine-tune a model using a training file and a validation file, and then monitors the fine-tuning job until completion. Below is a detailed explanation of each part of the code:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Imports:**\n",
        "* **openai**: The OpenAI Python client, used to interact with the OpenAI API.\n",
        "* time: The time module is used to create pauses (delays) in the code execution, allowing for periodic status checks.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Variables**:\n",
        "* **training_file_id**: This is the ID of the training file (a file containing data used to train the model). You need to replace the placeholder with the actual ID of the file you're using for training.\n",
        "* **validation_file_id**: This is the ID of the validation file (a file containing data used to evaluate the model's performance during training). Similarly, replace this placeholder with the actual ID of your validation file.\n",
        "base_model: The base model you want to fine-tune. In this case, it's set to gpt-3.5-turbo, but you can change it to gpt-4 if necessary.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Fine-tuning Request**:\n",
        "* The **openai.fine_tuning.jobs.create()** method starts the fine-tuning process. It sends a request to OpenAI’s API to initiate fine-tuning using the provided training and validation files and the selected base model.\n",
        "  * **training_file**: The ID of the training file.\n",
        "  * **validation_file**: The ID of the validation file (important for tracking how well the model is performing during training).\n",
        "  * model: The base model to be fine-tuned (gpt-3.5-turbo in this case).\n",
        "* The response from the API contains the job ID, which is saved to the job_id variable for future reference.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Job Monitoring**:\n",
        "* A loop is used to periodically check the fine-tuning job's status.\n",
        "* openai.fine_tuning.jobs.retrieve(job_id): This retrieves the current status of the fine-tuning job using the job ID.\n",
        "* status: The current status of the job (e.g., pending, in_progress, succeeded, failed, etc.).\n",
        "* Metrics: If available, the job’s metrics, such as training and validation loss, are displayed. These metrics help track the model’s performance during fine-tuning.\n",
        "  * Training loss: Indicates how well the model is learning from the training data.\n",
        "  * Validation loss: Indicates how well the model is performing on unseen data (the validation set).\n",
        "\n",
        "**Checking Job Completion**:\n",
        "* The code continues to check the job status every 60 seconds (**time.sleep(60)**) until the job reaches one of the final states: succeeded, failed, or cancelled.\n",
        "* If the job is completed (i.e., status is succeeded), the fine-tuned model’s name is retrieved from the job_status object.\n",
        "* If the fine-tuning job is successful, the model name is printed; if it failed or was cancelled, an error message is shown.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Final Output**:\n",
        "* If the job succeeded, the fine-tuned model's name (fine_tuned_model) is displayed.\n",
        "* If the job failed or was cancelled, a warning message is displayed instead.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key Points**:\n",
        "* Fine-tuning is an iterative process, and this code monitors the status and tracks progress.\n",
        "* Using a validation file helps ensure that the model generalizes well and avoids overfitting to the training data.\n",
        "* The code includes checks to display training and validation losses for more transparency into how the fine-tuning is progressing.\n",
